## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

One of the biggest things I leanred in this project was how to setup a grid layout for the page.  This made it much easier to do an initial layout of all elements and especially to change the layout for different screen sizes.

The second biggest thing I learned was how to put a form button insde an input field.  This took me awhile to figure out and involved a lot of researching.


### Continued development

In the future I will continue to refine my use of a grid layout and get more comfortable using rem and % values for element sizing and position.  I also became aware that my javascript skills are very rusty and I will continue to delevope those in the upcoming projects.

I also have been having a difficult time getting my projects to live deploy and that will be a big focus on my next project as well.
